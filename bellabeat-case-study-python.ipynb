This dataset is hosted on Kaggle and made available under the CC0 Public Domain license by [Mobius](http://https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic). It consists of 18 .csv files, containing detailed information on activity metrics, calories burned, sleep records, metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs), heart rate, and steps. These metrics are recorded across different timeframes, including seconds, minutes, hours, and days, allowing for a granular analysis of fitness behaviors.\n\nBy leveraging this dataset, the case study aims to explore patterns and trends in fitness activities, offering a deeper understanding of how individuals engage with their routines and the impact on their overall health.\nHowever, it is important to note some limitations that could affect the results of the analysis:\n\n-Missing Demographics: The dataset lacks demographic information, which may limit the ability to analyze trends based on age, gender, or other factors.\n\nSmall Sample Size: The limited number of participants in the dataset may not fully represent the broader population, potentially impacting the generalizability of the findings.\n\n-Short Data Collection Period: The data was collected over a relatively short period, which may not capture long-term trends or seasonal variations.\n\n*These limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the results of the analysis.*\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 3: Process\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Loading Libraries**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport datetime as dt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"de548d43-90ca-40ac-801c-1c75ed821fb5","_cell_guid":"c2eba91d-6d95-4f37-96b4-8d47c641621c","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-09T19:23:43.107169Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-09T19:23:43.107929Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-09T19:23:43.112707Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-09T19:23:43.107895Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-09T19:23:43.111626Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Importing Datasets***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"9cf07fe5-1dad-4c7f-ae02-1b5882d23ea1","_cell_guid":"c12427d7-4be4-4f46-8af4-051f0d20f4ef","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-09T19:23:47.453442Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-09T19:23:47.453857Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-09T19:23:47.472678Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-09T19:23:47.453827Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-09T19:23:47.471540Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Importing the dataset \"daily_activity_merged.csv\" using the pandas pd.read.csv() function***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/fitbit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv')","metadata":{"_uuid":"3e450128-eb20-4ad7-9b51-d906b3595aa4","_cell_guid":"c17b7edd-0246-46e1-92b6-f5577daac1ab","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-09T19:23:51.218096Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-09T19:23:51.219074Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-09T19:23:51.243499Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-09T19:23:51.219038Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-09T19:23:51.242498Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Data Exploration***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","metadata":{"_uuid":"eca97952-d706-475c-b676-089d8b8c8252","_cell_guid":"0f4d222e-a4a7-4eb9-a15d-ee6457955da2","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-09T19:20:15.990037Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-09T19:20:15.991046Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-09T19:20:15.990751Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-09T19:20:15.990777Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have 940 rows and 15 columns in the dataset.
